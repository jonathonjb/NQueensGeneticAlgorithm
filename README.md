This uses a simple genetic algorithm to solve the NQueens problem. 

You can choose the population size, number of evolution cycles, the mutation probability rate, and the probability threshold (percentage of each population which will be removed in each cycles; the removed elements will always be the ones that performs the worst. In the NQueens problem, the worst elements are the ones where there are many queens attacking each other).
